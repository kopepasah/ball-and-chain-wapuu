# Ball and Chain Wapuu

Wapuu created for my talk at WordCamp US 2023, and is meant to be a double entendre about both my past and how I am chained to WordPress!

- Created by my amazing partner and fine artist [Jiwon Lee](https://jiwon.art).
- Designed by the awesome digital artist [Sheila Bravo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheilacbravo/).
